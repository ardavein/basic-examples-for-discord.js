Hello everyone, i made an example of a bot with discord.js v14,
It made by Ardavein#3565 -> https://github.com/ardavein https://instagram.com/ardabaskaya
If you wanna support me, you can add this bot to your server. https://bit.ly/3vv7l0i
SOME TIPS: 
Don't try to install 'discord-api-types' module like this:
npm i discord-api-types/v9
Try to install like this
npm i discord-api-types
it will install everything in the module.
